# Do App
There is nothing superfluous in the project! And everything is done for maximum convenience of use.  

**A unique idea is plugins.**  
Differentiation of the bot's functionality: moderation commands are a separate plugin, the music player is a separate plugin, the user reputation system is a separate plugin. Which makes it convenient to work on the feature in one place.  
Thanks to this structure, it is easier to share your work with others: just upload a folder and all dependencies will be installed automatically - you get a ready-made system for your application.

**WARNING!**  
The project is at the idea stage! Not ready for real development, expect a release version.

## Background
This repository is a reworking of the old version of the do app (https://github.com/exhertz/do-discord-app). This happened because of the "heaviness" and clutter of the old project.
